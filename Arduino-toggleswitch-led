//Had some issues with this code. Maybe swtich pin 2 to pin 3 instead? Or refer to my other codes 

//Setup notes For Arduino Code: 
// Connect wiring as follows https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-buttons-and-switches-on-the-raspberry-pi/ 
// Use a 1k Ohm resistor for the pull-up resistor for the toggle switch circuit 
// Use a 220 Ohm resistor for the LED 
// Rocker on/off switch (basic toggle switch) from Amazon
// https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XC5KB8D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 

// Wiring for the LED: 
// Connect 220 ohm resitor to the side of the LED which is longer, and then into pin 9
// Connect the other side of the LED (shorter side) to GND 

// Wiring for the Toggle Switch (includes pullup resistor): 
// Connect the black/GND side of the Toggle switch to pin 2 
// Connect the other (red) side of the Toggle switch to a splitter 
// One side of the splitter goes to 5V OR to 3.3V (either works) 
// The other side of the splitter goes to 1k Ohm resistor and then to GND 

const int pinSwitch = 2; 
const int pinLed =  9; 
int buttonState = 0; //variable for reading the pushbutton status 

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  
  pinMode(pinLed, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(pinLed, LOW);
  pinMode(pinSwitch, INPUT);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

   buttonState = digitalRead(pinSwitch);

   if (buttonState == LOW) 
   {
    digitalWrite(pinLed, HIGH);
    }

   else 
  {
   digitalWrite(pinLed, LOW);
    }

  
}
